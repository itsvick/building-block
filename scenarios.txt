1. check without optional dependency == Gives error while serving for missing import
2. Create one module with secondary entry point and use lodash es module
3. Check if all tests are running properly for all the components (including secondary entry points)
4. Test whether internal use of components between secondary points works properly
4. Note down the stats for each scenario

Scenarios:

1. Use core library
2. Use core library with secondary point
3. Use core library having peer-dependency
4. Use secondary point with dependency
5. Use secondary point in lazy loaded route
6. Test if core library has some services. The dial-code module (secondary entry point) also dependent on the core services.
7. Test if core library has some services. The client component (let say question component) also dependent on the core services.
